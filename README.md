# OSDL
Your directory for operating system download links.

## Aims?
Finding an operating, especially one that's not made for consumers, or one that is in beta stage, is hard.

For this reason, OSDL was made, to store the download links to every OS known to man.

## State
For now, no OSes has been added to the repo.
